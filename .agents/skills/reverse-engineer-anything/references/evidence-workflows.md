# Evidence, comparison, and verification workflows

Evidence-producing tools return the complete Evidence record directly in MCP
`structuredContent` and CLI JSON. Read `normalized_result` for operation data,
and cite `evidence_id` when another tool or your explanation needs a stable
reference. Preserve authority, limitations, coverage, and residual unknowns. If a result
is incomplete or paginated, continue only when the remaining data matters to
the task; do not fetch a bundle or resource merely to read a result already
returned inline. When complete `inspect_binary_layout` or
`analyze_javascript_application` Evidence is already retained, call
`inspect_analysis_view` for a summary, one section/symbol/module, or a stable
page instead of repeating the producer.

Completed `inspect_artifact` inventory also supports a summary and
`view: {kind: "inventory", collection: "occurrences", logical_paths: ["package.json", "main.js"]}`.
Omit `logical_paths` to page all available occurrences; `[]` selects none.
Other inventory collections are `nodes`, `edges` and
`integrity_contradictions`. Keep `source_complete` separate from page exhaustion:
a missing match in partial source Evidence does not establish absence. Use the
returned parent Evidence ID for subsequent views and export before closing the
session when the source must survive it.
When `tools/list` advertises `inspect_artifact.detail`, request `"summary"` to
retain its complete source and receive that view immediately. Without that
advertised choice, keep the existing complete call. CLI inspection returns
portable complete Evidence; save it before projecting a selected inline view.

Use `record_unknown` to track unresolved questions in the user's investigation
and name the authority or environment still required. Supply supporting and
contradicting evidence IDs. It updates the session registry directly.
Use `update_unknown` with the current revision; reread after a stale revision
instead of retrying blindly. Only qualifying observed evidence can verify a
resolution.

Use comparisons with complete, compatible page sets when claiming equivalence
or absence:

- `compare_artifacts` compares inventory pages by occurrence path, content,
  metadata, and graph relations.
- `compare_functions` compares explicit function Evidence, not fuzzy
  whole-binary matches.
- `compare_bundles` compares canonical bundle membership and unknown history.
- `find_changed_behavior` combines existing comparisons; static differences
  remain candidates, not causal proof.
- `build_call_path` needs explicit function dossiers from one artifact/provider;
  an incomplete frontier makes absence unknown.
- `correlate_static_and_runtime` uses explicit mappings; matching patterns are
  hypotheses, not causality.
- `verify_reconstruction` evaluates a finite typed specification. A pass covers
  only declared comparable claims, not global equivalence.

Process captures are opt-in behavioral evidence, not a security sandbox. V3
captures cannot be upgraded to V4; rerun the original scenario. Distinguish root
exit from descendant settlement and require freshness when the task needs it.
A timed-out target that must write a final report needs `finalization_ms`: REA
sends SIGTERM to the captured root, keeps observing, and sends SIGKILL once
only if the target has not exited by the end of the interval.
`exit.finalization.signals` lists each attempt with its delivery result; the
observed exit signal stays in `exit.signal`, `exit.code` is null for every
deadline exit, and the code of a finalizer that exited on its own is in
`exit.finalization.exit_code` (null on a signal exit or when no exit was
observed).

Use `inspect_analysis_view` with `view: {kind: "api-surface"}` on retained
`inspect_web_network_capture` HAR Evidence to group observed request lines by
method, origin and path template. Format matches are inferences, not handler
identity or schemas. Group pages cite parent record ordinals; consult record
coverage and exclusions before claiming completeness. No requests are replayed.
When the connected schema advertises `include_query_parameter_names`, select
it in the view for distinct observed names with original record ordinals. Query
values are omitted; the names establish neither required parameters nor a
complete server schema. Keep the original parent Evidence for exact URLs.

## Page oversized and truncated results

Return to [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md) for the summary-first rule. Use this section
when a result is too large for the client or a retained parent ID is the next
read.

For a JavaScript application or ELF layout whose size is unknown or large,
call `analyze_javascript_application` or `inspect_binary_layout` with
`"detail": "summary"`, then inspect the retained `parent_evidence_id` with
`inspect_analysis_view`. Page module identities and select the returned
`node_id` before requesting an item; a single file path can represent several
graph roles. Do not repeat an identical analysis or rejected call without a
changed input or resolved blocker. Recheck session state when a lifecycle
change makes that status useful. Make a focused follow-up only when the
returned result leaves a specific question unanswered.

If MCP reports `resource_constraint` with `details.resource: "transport"`, call
`inspect_analysis_view` with its reported same-session Evidence reference for a
summary, one section/module, or a stable page. Use `trace_application_feature`
once a seed is known, or call `export_evidence_bundle` to write the complete
session to a selected path. The analysis remains complete in the ledger; avoid
repeating it merely to request the same oversized response. Complete CLI JSON
output also streams without a single MCP frame.

When the retained parent ID is unknown, use `get_evidence_bundle` with
`detail: "summary"` and exact filters for operation, target SHA-256,
analysis-profile digest or canonical procedure address. Select its returned
Evidence ID for the next view instead of requesting the complete bundle.
`retention: "complete-record"` means the whole record is stored; native
value-flow truncation and unknown metadata remain separate. For an exported
portable bundle, use `rea inspect-evidence-bundle` with JSON containing `path`,
`detail: "summary"` and the same `filters`. Reading that file still requires
validating its full contents within the local memory budget.

A client can also truncate a successful tool result without a REA transport
error. Treat that preview as incomplete; use the retained parent ID for smaller
views or export when the full record is needed. Do not parse the preview as
canonical JSON or repeat the producer. For JavaScript, read the
[module-view and trace recipes](javascript-applications.md) before drilling
into a large graph; a broad bidirectional trace can expand unrelated
containment relationships even after summary analysis.
